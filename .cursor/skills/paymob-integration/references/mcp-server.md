# Paymob MCP Server (live merchant access)

Paymob runs an **official, first-party MCP server** that lets an AI agent act on a merchant's real Paymob account — create payment intentions and payment links, pull transactions/balances, export reports, and more — instead of only generating code. It complements this skill: use the **skill's code references** to build the merchant's app, and use the **MCP server** for live account actions, testing, and reconciliation from inside the agent.

- **Endpoint:** `https://mcp.paymob.com/mcp`
- **Transport:** Streamable HTTP (remote MCP; no local install)
- **Server:** "Paymob Payment System" (verified live at time of writing)
- **Auth:** bring-your-own Paymob API credentials, configured **in-session** (see below). Connecting requires no credentials — the server does nothing until you provide yours.

> This is a hosted service run by Paymob. You send it your own Paymob API key + secret key, and it acts on your account. Treat it with the same care as your dashboard login: start in **test mode** (`is_live: false`), and understand that it includes money-movement tools (see the security note).

## Connecting

### Claude Code — via this plugin (automatic)

This repo ships a `.mcp.json` at its root, so when the `paymob-integration` plugin is installed/enabled, Claude Code registers the `paymob` MCP server automatically. Approve it when prompted.

### Claude Code — standalone (without the plugin)

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http paymob https://mcp.paymob.com/mcp
```

### Any client via `.mcp.json` (Cursor, VS Code, Claude Code project scope, …)

Add to the project's `.mcp.json` (or the client's MCP config):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paymob": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.paymob.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

`type` may also be written as `streamable-http` (an alias for `http`) if you're copying from other tooling. An entry with a `url` but **no `type`** is a configuration error.

### Cursor

Add the same object to `.cursor/mcp.json` (project) or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global).

## Authenticating (per session)

The server follows a "configure, test, use" flow — its own `get_help` and `get_usage_examples` tools document it live:

1. **Configure credentials** — provide your Paymob **API key** and **secret key** (from Dashboard → Developers → API Keys) to the server's credential-setup tool (`set_api_credentials`). Use **test** credentials first.
2. **Test connectivity** — `test_api_connectivity` verifies the credentials work.
3. **Discover methods** — `get_available_payment_methods` (pass `currency`, `is_live: false`) lists the Integration IDs available to you.

Then call any action tool. Prefer the `elicit_*` tools for guided, step-by-step setup that fills required fields correctly.

## Tool catalog (~25 tools)

**Guided setup (start here):** `elicit_payment_intention`, `elicit_payment_link`, `elicit_scaling_payment_link`, `elicit_transaction_filters`, `elicit_transfer_filters` — walk you through required fields before you call the matching create/query tool.

**Create & manage payments (write):**
- `create_payment_intention` / `update_payment_intention` — Intention (Flash) API: `amount` (cents), `currency`, `payment_methods` (Integration IDs), `billing_data`, optional `items`, `special_reference`, `redirection_url`, `notification_url`.
- `create_payment_link` — single-customer shareable link.
- `create_scaling_payment_link` — multi-customer link (crowdfunding/donations), with optional usage limits.
- `create_invoice` — invoice for payment collection.

**Read / reporting (read-only):**
- `get_merchant_transactions`, `get_filtered_transactions` (date/amount/currency/status/…), `export_transactions` (Excel).
- `get_merchant_transfers`, `get_filtered_transfers`.
- `get_merchant_balances` — available balances per account/currency.
- `get_merchant_payment_links`, `get_payment_link_by_token`.
- `get_invoices`.
- `get_available_payment_methods`, `test_api_connectivity`.

**Money movement (write — high impact):**
- `request_instant_settlement` — moves funds from your Paymob balance to your bank account.

**Support & help:**
- `create_support_ticket` — open a support ticket (terminal/payment issues).
- `get_help`, `get_usage_examples` — the server's own live docs; call these first if a tool's fields are unclear.

> The exact tool list is versioned by Paymob and may change. Call `tools/list` (or `get_help`) against the live server for the current set rather than treating this catalog as fixed.

---

## Security

- **Credentials are yours.** The server acts with your Paymob API key + secret key. Never paste **live** keys until you've validated the flow in **test mode** (`is_live: false`).
- **It can move money.** `request_instant_settlement` transfers funds to your bank; `create_payment_intention`, `create_payment_link`, and `create_invoice` create real payment obligations when `is_live: true`.
- **Authorize each live write.** The primary agent must confirm the current account, mode, operation, target, amount, and currency with the user. Do not reuse blanket approval, share credentials with subagents, or let an unattended agent call authenticated tools.
- **Prevent duplicate writes.** Read remote state first and retain a stable operation fingerprint/merchant reference. Never automatically retry a timeout or ambiguous response; query by the same reference to determine whether the original succeeded, then verify and report the resulting remote status.
- **Don't commit secrets.** The `.mcp.json` in this repo contains only the public endpoint URL — no keys. Credentials are supplied at runtime via the credential-setup tool, not stored in the repo.
- **Prefer read-only for automation.** For dashboards/reconciliation jobs, lean on the `get_*` / `export_*` tools, which are read-only.

## MCP server vs. code references — when to use which

| Use the **MCP server** when… | Use the **skill's code references** when… |
|---|---|
| Testing your account interactively (create a test intention/link, then pull it back) | Building the merchant's actual app/backend |
| Reconciling: pulling transactions, balances, transfers, exports | Implementing the HMAC-verified webhook (the source of truth) |
| Ad-hoc ops: issue a payment link, open a support ticket, request a settlement | Shipping production checkout, mobile SDK, or subscriptions code |

The MCP server does **not** replace your webhook: payment status in your app must still come from the HMAC-verified callback (`references/hmac-verification.md`), reconciled with Transaction Inquiry (`references/transaction-inquiry.md`) — which the MCP `get_*` tools make easy to do by hand.
