# Advanced Features — Subscriptions, Saved Cards, Auth/Capture, Refund/Void, Split, Convenience Fees

All endpoints below use the regional base URL from `intention-api.md` and, unless noted, the header `Authorization: Token <SECRET_KEY>` (the literal word `Token`, not `Bearer`). Amounts are in **cents** (10000 = 100.00 EGP). Verify exact current shapes against the live docs (`live-resources.md`) before going live — some of these features must be enabled on the merchant's account by Paymob first.

---

## Refund / Void / Capture (post-payment operations)

These act on a completed transaction by its `transaction_id` (from the verified callback).

Before any live refund, void, or capture, read the current transaction state and obtain explicit confirmation for this exact account, mode, operation, transaction, amount, and currency. Keep a stable operation fingerprint. Never auto-retry after a timeout or ambiguous response; inquire whether the first request succeeded, then verify and report the final remote state.

```http
POST {base_url}/api/acceptance/void_refund/refund
Authorization: Token {SECRET_KEY}
Content-Type: application/json

{ "transaction_id": 12345, "amount_cents": 10000 }
```

```http
POST {base_url}/api/acceptance/void_refund/void
Authorization: Token {SECRET_KEY}
Content-Type: application/json

{ "transaction_id": 12345 }
```

```http
POST {base_url}/api/acceptance/capture
Authorization: Token {SECRET_KEY}
Content-Type: application/json

{ "transaction_id": 12345, "amount_cents": 10000 }
```

- **Refund** — returns funds after settlement (full or partial via `amount_cents`). Availability varies by method (cards: yes; wallets: yes; most BNPL/kiosk: no — see the payment-methods notes in `intention-api.md`).
- **Void** — cancels an authorization/transaction before settlement (card only).
- **Capture** — captures a previously authorized (Auth/Capture) transaction.

```javascript
// Node.js — refund/void/capture share the same auth header
const axios = require('axios');
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.PAYMOB_BASE_URL,            // e.g. https://accept.paymob.com
  headers: { Authorization: `Token ${process.env.PAYMOB_SECRET_KEY}` },
});

const refund  = (transactionId, amountCents) =>
  api.post('/api/acceptance/void_refund/refund', { transaction_id: transactionId, amount_cents: amountCents }).then(r => r.data);
const voidTxn = (transactionId) =>
  api.post('/api/acceptance/void_refund/void', { transaction_id: transactionId }).then(r => r.data);
const capture = (transactionId, amountCents) =>
  api.post('/api/acceptance/capture', { transaction_id: transactionId, amount_cents: amountCents }).then(r => r.data);
```

---

## Auth / Capture (two-step: authorize now, capture later)

Reserve funds at checkout, capture (or void) them later — useful for order-fulfillment-on-ship models.

1. Create the Intention with the auth flag set, then check out as normal:

```json
{
  "amount": 10000,
  "currency": "EGP",
  "payment_methods": [123456],
  "is_auth": true,
  "billing_data": { "phone_number": "+201234567890", "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe", "email": "john@example.com" },
  "special_reference": "order_123",
  "notification_url": "https://yoursite.com/api/paymob/callback",
  "redirection_url": "https://yoursite.com/checkout/result"
}
```

2. The callback arrives with `is_auth: true` and the funds held. Later, capture:

```http
POST {base_url}/api/acceptance/capture
Authorization: Token {SECRET_KEY}
{ "transaction_id": 12345, "amount_cents": 10000 }
```

   …or release the hold with the **void** endpoint above.

> Some accounts use `payment_type: "AUTH"` instead of `is_auth: true` on the Intention. Confirm which your merchant's account expects against the live docs.

## Saved Cards — CIT then MIT

### CIT (Customer-Initiated Transaction) — tokenize on first payment

The first payment must be customer-initiated. Ask Paymob/the dashboard to enable card tokenization for the Integration ID, and request tokenization on the Intention (commonly via `extras.save_card` — confirm the current flag name in the live docs):

```json
{
  "amount": 10000,
  "currency": "EGP",
  "payment_methods": [123456],
  "billing_data": { "phone_number": "+201234567890", "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe", "email": "john@example.com" },
  "customer": { "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe", "email": "john@example.com" },
  "special_reference": "order_123",
  "notification_url": "https://yoursite.com/webhook",
  "redirection_url": "https://yoursite.com/complete",
  "extras": { "save_card": true }
}
```

After a successful tokenization, Paymob sends a **Card Token callback** — verify it with the **Card Token HMAC** (different field set/order from the transaction HMAC) before storing the token:

**Card Token HMAC** — 8 fields, SHA-512, concatenated in this exact order, no separator:
```
card_subtype, created_at, email, id, masked_pan, merchant_id, order_id, token
```

```javascript
// Node.js — Card Token HMAC verification
const crypto = require('crypto');
function verifyCardTokenHmac(data, receivedHmac, secret) {
  const fields = [
    data.card_subtype, data.created_at, data.email, data.id,
    data.masked_pan, data.merchant_id, data.order_id, data.token,
  ];
  const computed = crypto.createHmac('sha512', secret)
    .update(fields.map(String).join('')).digest('hex');
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(computed), Buffer.from(receivedHmac));
}
```

Store **only** `token` and `masked_pan` (and the customer linkage). Never store raw card data. Verify the token-callback `email` matches your customer record.

### MIT (Merchant-Initiated Transaction) — charge the saved token later

1. Create an Intention as normal (gives you a `client_secret`).
2. Instead of redirecting the customer, charge the stored token directly:

```http
POST {base_url}/api/acceptance/payments/pay
Authorization: Token {SECRET_KEY}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "source": { "identifier": "SAVED_CARD_TOKEN", "subtype": "TOKEN" },
  "payment_token": "INTENTION_CLIENT_SECRET"
}
```

3. A `success: true` response (and the subsequent callback) means the card was charged with no customer interaction. MIT charges must comply with PCI/scheme rules — these are off-session payments the customer has pre-authorized.

You can also let the customer pick a previously saved card inside Unified Checkout / the SDK by passing the saved `card_tokens` on the Intention (CIT one-click) — confirm the current field name in the live docs.

---

## Subscriptions (recurring billing)

Subscriptions are available to selected merchants — Paymob must enable the feature on the account.

### Auth note
Subscription **plan management** uses a Bearer auth token (from the API-Key auth endpoint); attaching a subscription to a payment uses the normal `Authorization: Token <SECRET_KEY>` on the Intention.

```http
POST {base_url}/api/auth/tokens
Content-Type: application/json
{ "api_key": "<API_KEY>" }
# -> { "token": "<AUTH_TOKEN>" }
```

### Create a plan

```http
POST {base_url}/api/acceptance/subscription_plans
Authorization: Bearer {AUTH_TOKEN}
Content-Type: application/json

{ "name": "Monthly Pro", "amount_cents": 50000, "currency": "EGP",
  "frequency": 30, "reminder_days": 2, "retrial_days": 1 }
```

- Valid `frequency` values (days): **7, 15, 30, 60, 90, 180, 360**.
- The plan response returns a plan `id`.

### Start a subscription via the Intention

Attach the plan to a normal Intention (the first charge is CIT through checkout; subsequent charges are MIT auto-debits). Confirm the current attachment field name against the live docs — accounts use either `subscription_plan_id` on the Intention or a `recurring` object:

```json
{
  "amount": 50000,
  "currency": "EGP",
  "payment_methods": [123456],
  "subscription_plan_id": 789,
  "billing_data": { "phone_number": "+201234567890", "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe", "email": "john@example.com" },
  "special_reference": "sub_order_123",
  "notification_url": "https://yoursite.com/webhook",
  "redirection_url": "https://yoursite.com/complete"
}
```

### Subscription callbacks (Subscription HMAC)

Subscription events POST to your `notification_url`. The HMAC string is **not** the 20-field transaction concatenation — it is:

```
"{trigger_type}for{subscription_data.id}"
# e.g. "Subscription Createdfor12345"
```

and the `hmac` is in the **request body**, not the query string.

```python
# Python — Subscription HMAC verification
import hashlib, hmac
def verify_subscription_hmac(body: dict, secret: str) -> bool:
    s = f"{body['trigger_type']}for{body['subscription_data']['id']}"
    computed = hmac.new(secret.encode(), s.encode(), hashlib.sha512).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(computed, body['hmac'])
```

### Manage

```http
GET  {base_url}/api/acceptance/subscriptions/{subscription_id}              # status
POST {base_url}/api/acceptance/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/cancel       # cancel
Authorization: Token {SECRET_KEY}
```

Store `subscription_data.id` for future management. For patterns like free trials, see the Paymob community forum (`live-resources.md`).

---

## Split features

- **Split Amount** — distribute one payment's revenue among marketplace sub-accounts at payment time (marketplace/platform model). Configured on the Intention; requires the feature enabled on the account.
- **Split Payment** — let one customer pay a single order across up to ~3 cards.

Exact request fields evolve — pull the current spec from the live docs before implementing.

---

## Convenience fees

Add a fee on top of the order, configurable as **percentage**, **fixed**, or **combined**, and can be card-specific (debit vs credit, BIN range, domestic vs international) or wallet-specific. Enabled/configured per account; confirm the current Intention field shape in the live docs.

---

## Reminders

- Verify the correct HMAC type per callback: **transaction** (20 fields, query param), **card token** (8 fields, query param), **subscription** (string formula, request body). Wrong type/order silently breaks verification — see `hmac-verification.md`.
- Always SHA-512, always timing-safe compare, never log secrets.
- Treat every callback as the source of truth only **after** HMAC passes, and process idempotently on `order.id` / `special_reference`.
